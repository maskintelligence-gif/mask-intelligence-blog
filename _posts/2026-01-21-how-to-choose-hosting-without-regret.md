## Introduction: Hosting Is a Foundation, Not a Feature
Choosing hosting is one of the most underestimated decisions in web development.

Design can change.  
Code can be refactored.  
**Bad hosting quietly limits everything.**

After seeing projects fail, stall, or require painful migrations, one lesson stands out:

> **The right hosting doesn’t make your project successful —  
but the wrong hosting can guarantee failure.**

This guide will help you choose hosting **once**, with clarity and confidence.

---

## Step 1: Be Honest About What You’re Building
Before comparing providers, define your project honestly.

Ask yourself:
- Is this a **personal blog**, a **portfolio**, or a **business**?
- Will it have **user accounts**?
- Do I expect **traffic growth**?
- Do I need **email, background jobs, or APIs**?

{: .notice--warning}
**Mistake to avoid:** Choosing hosting based on price before understanding requirements.

---

## Step 2: Understand the Main Hosting Types
### 1. Shared Hosting
**Best for:** blogs, small sites, early projects  
**Pros:**
- Cheap ($2–5/month)
- Managed environment
- Beginner‑friendly

**Cons:**
- Shared resources
- Limited customization
- Performance varies

---

### 2. VPS (Virtual Private Server)
**Best for:** growing sites, developers, businesses  
**Pros:**
- Dedicated resources
- Full control
- Predictable performance

**Cons:**
- Requires server knowledge
- You manage security & updates

---

### 3. Managed Hosting (WordPress / SaaS)
**Best for:** non‑technical founders  
**Pros:**
- Security & updates handled
- Optimized performance
- Support included

**Cons:**
- Less flexibility
- Higher cost

---

### 4. Static & Serverless Hosting
**Best for:** JAMstack, documentation, landing pages  
**Pros:**
- Extremely fast
- Free or very cheap
- Global CDN

**Cons:**
- Not suitable for dynamic apps without services

---

## Step 3: The 7 Non‑Negotiables in Any Hosting Plan
If any of these are missing, walk away.

### 1. Resource Transparency
You should clearly see:
- CPU limits
- RAM limits
- Disk type (SSD/NVMe)
- Bandwidth caps

---

### 2. SSH or Proper Access
No access = no control.  
Even managed hosting should offer:
- SSH or equivalent
- File access
- Database access

---

### 3. Backups You Control
- Automatic backups
- **Manual restore access**
- Off‑server storage

---

### 4. Security Baseline
Minimum requirements:
- Free SSL
- Firewall
- Isolated accounts
- Regular patching

---

### 5. Migration Freedom
You must be able to:
- Export databases
- Download all files
- Point DNS elsewhere

---

### 6. Predictable Pricing
Watch out for:
- Intro prices that triple
- Paid backups
- Paid SSL
- Paid migrations

---

### 7. Real Support
Test support **before** you buy:
- Ask a technical question
- Measure response time
- Check clarity

---

## Step 4: Choosing Based on Your Stage
### 🚀 Just Starting
- Reputable shared hosting
- Static hosting if possible
- Avoid “free forever” traps

---

### 📈 Growing Project
- Entry‑level VPS
- Managed WordPress
- Clear upgrade paths

---

### 🏢 Business or Brand
- Paid VPS or managed hosting
- Backups + monitoring
- SLA and accountability

---

## Common Hosting Myths (That Hurt Projects)
- ❌ “I’ll upgrade later” → migrations are expensive
- ❌ “Free is good enough for now” → now becomes permanent
- ❌ “More RAM fixes everything” → bad architecture doesn’t scale
- ❌ “All hosts are the same” → they are not

---

## A Simple Hosting Decision Checklist
```yaml
Hosting Checklist:
  purpose: clear
  data_sensitivity: evaluated
  backups: confirmed
  access: ssh_or_equivalent
  exit_strategy: tested
  pricing: predictable
  support: responsive

If you can’t check all of these — don’t deploy.

## Choose Once, Build Forward;
Hosting should disappear into the background.

When chosen correctly:

- Your site stays online

- Performance is predictable

- Growth feels natural

- Migration is optional, not forced

## **Cheap hosting costs time.**
## **Bad hosting costs momentum.**

Choose a foundation that lets you focus on building — not firefighting.
